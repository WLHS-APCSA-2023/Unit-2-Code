In this project, you are going to design your own class and a tester for it. The class must have the following:

- At least 4 instance variables of 3 different types
- At least2 constructors (overloading)
- At least 2 void methods
- At least 2 non-void methods
- Extra Credit (2 pts.): Write a toString method that will print information about the object that you instantiated

The test must create at least two objects from your class and apply at least two methods to them, at least one void and one non-void.

Some examples could include an Animal class, a Student class, a Sandwich class, an Athlete class, a Game class, etc. Nouns are a good place to start. 
Have fun and be creative with it. Feel free to work with your programming partner, especially for debugging and testing.\

You will submit your class file (I don't mean .class file) to Java as well as the tester. You can refer to the code from lessons 3 and 4 if you need help.
